Contains the Readme, code and writeups for Task1 and Task2 included in Coding week-ML

TASK 1 
For task 1, we were onboarded to CampusPulse, a strategic data project initiated by the 
Student Wellness and Experience Board at IIT Guwahati. Our objective is to analyze real, 
anonymized student data collected from a survey to help uncover the hidden factors that 
influence student life on campus, from grades and screen time to relationships, stress, and 
social behaviors. 
This task consisted of 5 levels. 
Level 1- For level 1, I identified what Feature 1,2 and 3 represent using basic boxplots, 
histograms and correlation heatmaps. 
Level 2- For level 2, I identified columns having null values and then filled each one of them 
based on their dependence on other columns or on their own patterns. 
Level 3- For level 3, I performed EDA on all the features of the given dataset to identify any 
patterns among them. 
Level 4- For level 4, I checked patterns which other features had with the romantic 
relationship feature (target). Next, using 3 classification techniques I predicted the 
relationship status for each student and calculated the accuracy for each technique. 
Level 5- For level 5, I plotted the decision boundary graphs for each of the 3 techniques and 
then using SHAP, I plotted the global and local importance of each feature on our models.

TASK 2 
For task 2, we were tasked to be in Project SkyLink, an elite 
initiative to construct a powerful AI entity the WeatherMind, 
capable of perceiving the world, interpreting human queries, 
and delivering precise, contextual responses through tool
enhanced reasoning. 
For this task an AI was created having 3 agents which 
themselves had tools inside. Prompts were given and output 
was received calling different agents and using different tools.
